# Android Audio Record in Stereo - Example project
This is just a small example to demonstrate how we can record stereo audio on Android and access the different channels
to gain access to multiple built-in microfones.


This project has been coded in less than an hour so I apologize for the bad quality.  


Tested on Samsung Galaxy S5 with Android 5.0.
